**_The Technical Details_**  
This is a simple timer-based quiz created from scratch - yup, custom CSS. The game logic relies on JavaScript, with jQuery to manipulate the DOM. Here's my [pseudocode](https://github.com/pathak-neha/TriviaGame/blob/master/pseudocode.txt "View Pseudocode"), if you're interested in the thought process that goes into creating a quiz like this.

If you're looking for most of the DOM content, look in the [JavaScript file](https://github.com/pathak-neha/TriviaGame/blob/master/assets/javascript/game.js "Go to JS"). The [HTML file](https://github.com/pathak-neha/TriviaGame/blob/master/index.html "Go to HTML") only contains the several empty sections of the game, most of them hidden until the user interacts with the game.

**_The Design Process_**
This was one of my earliest works in Front End Design, just around a month after I learned how to put together a webpage! So I'm very proud of how it turned out.

I wanted to try and build a website that would look just as good on mobile browsers, and I knew that one of the biggest challenges was creating a pretty and scalable background. I relied _heavily_ on my Graphic Design experience to come up with [this PNG](https://github.com/pathak-neha/TriviaGame/blob/master/assets/images/castle-2.png "Final Background") image for the background. [Here's a graveyard](https://github.com/pathak-neha/TriviaGame/tree/master/assets/images "Alt Images") of all the images I tried before finalizing my background image.

The solution that seemed most natural to me was to use [Photoshop](https://github.com/pathak-neha/TriviaGame/blob/master/assets/images/castle-2.psd "View PSD") to give the image transparent edges, and use relative positioning for the background image. While not the most refined solution, I wanted to leave this up as a testament to my ability to think creatively even in the earliest stages of my learning of web development.
